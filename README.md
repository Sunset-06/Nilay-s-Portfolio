A very simple Portfolio that I made as a project after going through the MDN Frontend Course that uses HTML, CSS and vanilla JS.

I still have to make it responsive, which requires me to work around the scroll-snap that I used, but until then you can check out the desktop website that is deployed at: https://sunset-06.github.io/Nilay-s-Portfolio/
